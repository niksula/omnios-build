#
# OmniOS-on-demand is a wrapper script designed to be run by cron(1) once
# per minute.
#
# Every minute it checks for "gate churn", that is, changes to source repos.
# If there is no gate churn, AND no previously recorded gate churn, this
# script exits immediately.
#
# If there is gate churn, the script records it (see STATEFILE below), and
# subsequent gate churn checks are counted.  Once DELAY_CYCLES times without
# gate churn have run, then the build happens.
#
# This script assumes being run by cron as a regular user.  To this end, a
# file needs to be dropped into /etc/sudoers.d, so root-requiring omnios-build
# scripts (notably Kayak) can be run.
#
# This script also takes advantage of PREBUILT_ILLUMOS in omnios-build to
# run the illumos-omnios nightly.sh script in parallel with the rest of
# omnios-build.  Because of quirks in omnios-build, this is not as
# Amdahl's Law efficient as desired.  Subsequent fixes to omnios-build may
# eliminate those chokepoints, if not even the need for PREBUILT_ILLUMOS.
